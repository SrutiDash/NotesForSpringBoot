Creating REST APIs in Spring Boot, writing solid business logic using microservices.

Collections framework - ArrayList, HashSet, Iterator, HashMap, etc.

Concurrency and Multithreading - FCC has just released a 5 plus hour video on Multithreading recently.

Database connections with Java: Hibernate ORM, JDBC or Spring Data JPA, depending on use.

Being good at Java design patterns and understanding API experience layers (many companies use them).

Current tech trends for Java (based on my experience) include "migrations" from legacy Java 8 versions to Java 17/21 LTS versions, 
and also from Spring versions of 5 to 6, Spring Boot versions from 2 to 3, and re-writing business logic to ensure compatibilities, 
MAINLY because a lot of companies have been using Java 8 for a long time until very recently. Apart from that, concurrency, multi-threading 
and Java design patterns are also MUST.
